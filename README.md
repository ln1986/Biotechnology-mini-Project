# **Biotechnology-mini-Project:**
**Introduction:**

The study of enzyme kinetics and Analysis frequntly uses computational biological tools for better understanding without any parameters limitations.

To make the thing a way easier than before by analyzing biological data of enhancement of enzyme production through computational tools.

The computational method of data analysis of enzyme production could help the researchers to identify the spot trends, patteren and out-liners easily, so that they can improve experiment strategy and mathematical models according to them.


**Objective:**

Data Processing for a preliminary data set.

Data Visualization and Data Analytics of the processed data set.






 

# **Tools**
> Pandas

> Numpy

> Matplot

> Seaborn
> 
** Conclusion:**

Executed a comprehensive Biotechnology mini project focusing on Data Analytics and Data Visualization using Python for CuS nanohybrids, resulting in a 40% reduction in data processing time and increased research efficiency by 25%.
